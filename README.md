# Car-Detection-and-Counting
# Approach
This project uses **YOLOv8** for car detection and **Norfair** for tracking moving cars in video frames. The goal is to count the number of cars passing through a designated line.

# Technologies and Tools
- **Pycharm** software coding
- **YOLOv8** for object detection
- **Norfair** for object tracking
- **OpenCV** for video processing
- **NumPy** for numerical operations

# Steps to reproduce
1. pip install ultralytics, norfair, opencv-python, numpy
2. download car.mp4
3. run the DetectCar.py file
